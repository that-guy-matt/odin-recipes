        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When most people think pizza, they think Italy, but Flammkuchen (also called Flammekueche or tarte flambé in French), the crispy and smoky pizza from the France / Germany border, is definitely worth your time!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 c unbleached all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>½ tsp salt </li>
            <li>½ c water </li>
            <li>2 Tbsp olive oil </li>
            <li>1 c crème fraîche, or 1 c Greek yogurt, or slightly over 1 c plain yogurt, strained</li>
            <li>¼ tsp nutmeg </li>
            <li>2¼ lb bacon, diced </li>
            <li>2 onions, halved and sliced thin </li>
            <li>ground black pepper (to top) </li>
            <li>Cornmeal (for the pan) </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 500F. </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together flour, salt, water, and oil. Mix until a dough begins to form, the turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until it is soft and smooth, 3-5 min. Set the dough aside and cover it with a towel.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together crème fraîche and nutmeg. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large sauté pan, sauté bacon over medium high heat, until it is cooked about halfway to crisp, 2-4 minutes. Remove the bacon (keeping the grease in the pan) to a paper towel lined plate. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Place the sliced onions into the hot bacon grease and sauté over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, 10 min. Remove the pan from the heat. </li>
            <li>Roll and stretch the dough out into a rectangle, roughly 11x16 inches. Place the dough onto a large baking sheet that has been generously dusted with cornmeal. </li>
            <li>Spread the crème fraîche mixture over the crust, leaving just a little bare crust border. Distribute the caramelized onions over the crème fraîche, and sprinkle the bacon over the onions. Finish everything off with a dusting of black pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the baking sheet with the pizza into the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the pizza is crisp and the edges are starting to darken.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, cut, and serve immediately with some good wine. </li>
        </ol>
