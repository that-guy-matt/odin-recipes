        <p>A favorite during Karneval (Fasching, Fastnacht, Carnival, Mardi Gras) and New Year’s Eve, these rich and fluffy German doughnuts go by many names across Central Europe.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons (7 grams) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup (240 milliliters) lukewarm milk 105-115˚F, 40-46˚C</li>
            <li>4 cups (500 grams) all-purpose flour or Weizenmehl Type 405</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons (56 grams) unsalted butter softened at room temperature</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for deep-frying</li>
            <li>10 ounces (283 grams) jam raspberry, strawberry, plum, cherry, or apricot</li>
            <li>Powdered sugar or granulated sugar for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the lukewarm milk. Stir briefly and allow to sit at room temperature until frothy, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, lemon zest, and salt.</li>
            <li>Mix in the milk with frothy yeast, egg yolks, egg, and butter until a soft dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead on a lightly floured surface just until elastic and smooth. Place in a large bowl, cover, and allow to rest at room temperature until doubled, 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li>ROn a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a sheet about 3/4 inch (2 centimeters) thick.</li>
            <li>Cut out circles (do not twist) with a 3 inch (7.5 centimeter) circular cutter. Bring together the scraps of dough and repeat to get as many doughnuts as possible.</li>
            <li>Place the doughnuts 2 inches (5 centimeters) apart, cover with a towel, and allow to rise at room temperature until puffy, 30-60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour 2 inches (5 centimeters) of vegetable oil in a large saucepan and heat to 340˚F (170˚C), no higher.</li>
            <li>Once heated, gently add a few of the puffed doughnuts, taking care not to overcrowd. Immediately cover with a lid.</li>
            <li>Fry until lightly golden on the bottom, about 2 minutes, then remove the lid and flip to fry uncovered until golden on the other side.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a towel-lined platter and repeat with remaining doughnuts, keeping the temperature no higher than 340˚F (170˚C).</li>
            <li>If coating with granulated sugar, toss the doughnuts in a bowl of the sugar immediately after removing from the oil. If coating with powdered sugar, wait until after piping the doughnuts to coat.</li>
            <li>Once the doughnuts have slightly cooled, fill a pastry bag with a Bismark piping tip with desired jam.</li>
            <li>Pipe the jam into each doughnut, then top with powdered sugar.</li>
        </ol>
